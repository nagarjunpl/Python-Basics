# Python Variables

- A **variable** is used to store data in memory.
- It acts like a container with a name that holds a value.

## Rules for Variables
1. Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).
2. Cannot start with a number.
3. Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different).
4. Cannot use Python keywords (`for`, `while`, etc.).

## Examples
```python
x = 10          # integer
name = "Nagarjun"   # string
pi = 3.14       # float
is_student = True   # boolean
```
## Python allows variables to change type:

```
x = 10       # int
x = "hello"  # now string
